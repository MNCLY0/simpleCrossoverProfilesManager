## Features

Easy to use, with intuitive commands for profile management.

## Requirements
PowerShell (any version compatible with your Windows operating system).



## Features

- Save Profiles: Allows you to save the current configuration into a profile.
- Load Profiles: Allows you to load a previously saved configuration from a profile.


## Installation

Place the ProfilesManager.ps1 file in the following directory:
